# E-commerce-Back-End

## Description

This is the back end for an e-commerce site. It was built by taking a functional Express API and using the Sequelize ORM library to interact with a MySQL database. It is then tested in the Insomnia application.

## Steps taken

- Add Sequelize ORM in the Node.js application
- Define the Models
- Use the CRUD methods using Sequelize
- Join tables with Sequelize associations
- Configure Heroku for deployment of the application
- Add bcrypt package to hash password and protect sensitive data
